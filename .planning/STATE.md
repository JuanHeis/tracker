## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Investment model refactored before currency work (currency depends on correct investment accounts)
- Roadmap: Phases 6, 7, 8 are independent features that only depend on Phase 5 (monthly card) being correct
- Roadmap: Persistence and UX polish deferred to final phase as cross-cutting concerns
- 01-01: Canonical investment types: Plazo Fijo, FCI, Crypto, Acciones (dropped Bonos, Otros)
- 01-01: Used editingInvestment prop directly for edit defaults instead of separate defaultValues prop
- 01-02: Use date-fns addMonths with end-of-month clamping instead of raw Date.setMonth
- 01-02: Force form remount via React key prop rather than switching to controlled inputs
- 01-03: Total field formula changed - investments not added to total (blocked money, not income)
- 01-03: Validation on expense/income forms only; investment dialog has own component
- 01-03: Reset clears both monthlyData and lastUsedUsdRate from localStorage

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Brownfield project: data migration from current localStorage schema must preserve existing user data at each refactor phase
